- **Graylog Report Automation**  
  Python script that asynchronously fetches, sanitizes, correlates, and exports log data from multiple clients via Graylog’s REST API.  
  Designed for SOC automation, academic reporting, and portfolio-grade presentation.

- **Linear Regression Starting Project**  
  Built a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on the area of the house.  
  Explored the dataset to understand its structure and relationships, followed by data preparation to handle missing values.  
  Split the data into training and test sets, then trained a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.  
  Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score, and visualized results with regression lines overlaid on actual data points.

- **Wine Classification Models**  
  Built and compared six classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM) to predict wine types based on chemical properties.  
  The dataset was preprocessed with scaling and split into training and test sets. Each model was evaluated using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.  
  Results were stored in a comparison table and visualized for performance analysis.
