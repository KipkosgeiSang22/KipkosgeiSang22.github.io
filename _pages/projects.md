  - **Linera Regression starting project**  
linear regression model to predict housing prices based on the area of the house. The dataset was explored to understand its structure and relationships, followed by data preparation to handle any missing values. The data was then split into training and test sets, and a linear regression model was built using Scikit-learn. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score, and the results were visualized with regression lines overlaid on the actual data points
