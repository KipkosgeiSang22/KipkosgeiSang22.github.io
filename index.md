Welcome to my portfolio — a collection of projects focused on:

- 🔐 **Centralized Authentication** using LDAP and Active Directory
- 📊 **Log Parsing & Grok Extractors** for audit and compliance
- ⚙️ **Security Automation** in SOC environments
- 🧠 **Data Science Foundations** with Python and web scraping

Each project is designed with modularity, auditability, and scalability in mind. Whether you're a fellow analyst, engineer, or curious learner, I hope these resources help you build smarter, more secure systems.
